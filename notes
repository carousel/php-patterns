Patterns notes:

Patterns rely of OO paradigm concepts.They are abstracted from OO paradigm.

Prefer composition over inheritance
Abstraction levels numbers?
Abstract leads to concrete

FIRST PARADIGM AND THEN PATTERN

CLASSIFICATION
        - class based (relies on inheritance distribution) 
        - object based (relies on composition distribution)

Abstraction
Implementation - realization of specification (abstraction)
Instantiation - object realization

Creational → creation ( new keyword )

Structural → creation + structure
    - relationship between entities (instances,objects)

Behavioral → creation + structure + behavior
    - communication between entities

Structural:
    - entites are aware of each other
    - entities are smart
    - net of entities
    - visibility,scope,inheritance,associations

Behavioral:
    - entities are not aware of each other
    - entities are dumb
    - state change, message passing ?


decorator 
    - run-time
    - structural
